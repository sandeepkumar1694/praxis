## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd praxis-premium-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Build for production:**
    To create a production build, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    # yarn build
    ```
    The production files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

5.  **Linting:**
    To check for linting errors, run:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

For the AI task system to work, you'll also need to add these variables to your Supabase project settings:

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
TAVUS_API_KEY=your_tavus_api_key
TAVUS_REPLICA_ID=your_replica_id  
TAVUS_PERSONA_ID=your_persona_id
```

## Database Setup

1. Run the database migration to create the required tables:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the SQL in supabase/migrations/create_tasks_system.sql
   ```

2. Deploy the Edge Functions to Supabase:
   ```bash
   # Deploy all functions
   supabase functions deploy generate-daily-tasks
   supabase functions deploy get-daily-tasks
   supabase functions deploy choose-task
   supabase functions deploy submit-task-for-evaluation
   supabase functions deploy get-task-result
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in your Supabase project settings.
